Coffee Machine Project
Author: Alexander Reau

Objective:
To simulate a coffee machine offering a variety of drinks that have different
resources costs and pricing. The machine will be able to keep track of its resources
and give them in a report setting upon typing "report." The user will input their selected drink.

Before asking for payment, the program will confirm that there is enough resources for the drink.
If there is, the user will tell the program how much money they inserted into the machine
and make sure they have put in enough cash for the selected drink. Any extra cash will be given
out as change back to the user.

If there is enough resources and payment, the resources will be subtracted from the machine and
the money will be added to the machine.
